    behavioural graph virtual machine built on top of each event's `phases` field inside the game 
    for each player to match them for new game and rank them based on their in-game statuses, the 
    match making rating or ranking (**MMR**) engine, on the other hand is is a weighted tree based 
    suggestion engine that suggests players, events and other games and players based on their ranks 
    earned using **GVM** during the game.
    

    never return poiner from method just return vec or string but pass them in slice form to not to lose 
    their ownerhsip cause can't return ref to a data owned by the method we have to either ret the type in 
    its slice form with valid lifetime or return it as self.field cause self has longer lifetime also the 
    memory allocation process in rust depends on the types' lifetimes means that every type in rust has a 
    valid lifetime and as soon as the type gets moved into other scopes or threads or methods its lifetime 
    will be dropped from the ram and will be owned by that scope in other words we can't move out of a type
    or deref it if it's behind a shared ref or pointer also we can't have a type in two scopes at the same time
    without passing a reference or a clone of that into the second scopes, we should either clone the type or 
    borrow it and pass one of these to the second scope cause rust doesn't have gc to track the references 
    came to the type and use that to destroy the type when it reaches the zero instead it's using lifetime 
    conceptes which in single thread contexts we can use Rc to count the references of a type shared between 
    scopes but in multithread contexts we must use Arc and Mutex or RwLock to share the ownership of the type 
    between threads without having race conditions and deadlocks although rust forces us to use every type only 
    once during the whole lifetime of the app which this manner prevents us from allocating extra space on the 
    ram and deadlocks situation since the concept of ownership and borrowing is about sharing a type with 
    reference or cloning to not to lose its ownership in future scopes, if we allocate something in a scope we 
    can't move it out of that cause its being used inside that scopes, we have to borrow it or clone it or convert 
    it to its owned type if it's a sliced form or pointer of a type, slices are just a representation of dynamic 
    types with no dynamic allocation feature.

    this is lle parallel based vm and game engine graph like DOM, an state manager 
    like yew and redux with tree walking using (shared ref and mutably) using rc and 
    arc weak and strong ref counting, shared ownership and interior mutability, based on 
    actor and graph concepts so we have followers weighted tree to understand the 
    relationship between peers to suggests events in a graph virtual machine by using 

    lazy static global, mutexed, rwlocked, mpsc, rusty ltg pointers, slices, codec hash hex and file bytes,
    ret &'validlifetime ref and trait as param like -> impl Trait as type from method and use them in method 
    param like param: impl Trait from method also can't move type if it's behind pointer send sync static, 
    shared ownership using Mutex and RwLock and RefCell, GlobalAlloc arena referene counting using Rc Arc, Box 
    leaking, Pin, &mut type, cap, length, macros, Cow, Borrowed, ToOwned, Deref, &mut (ast, token stream), 
    std::mem, generic, lifetimes, closures, traits, pointers and bytecode, .so and .elf bpf, wasm, bytes and 
    hex serding and codec ops using borsh and serde, async trait and associative bounding Trait::method(): Send and 
    ?async and ?const, gen block, r3bl_rs_utils crate, read/write io traits, Box<dyn Trait>, as_ref(), unwrap(), clone() 
    and Box stores data on the heap and contains an smart pointer with a valid lifetime to the underlying type, 
    also the size of the boxed type is the size of the type itself, the value of the box can be caught 
    by dereferencing the box
    

    every type has its own lifetime and if it goes out of scope it'll be dropped from the ram and we can 
    either borrow it or clone it since rust dones't have gc instead it has rc, refcell for single thread 
    and arc and mutex for multithread reference counting and borrowing based on these concetps share ownership 
    between threads using Arc by borrowing the ownership using pointers like & clone share ownership between 
    scopes using Rc by  borrwoing the ownership using pointers like & and clone Rc is not safe to be used between 
    threads but Arc can be used to share the type between multiple threads safely without having race conditions, 
    also if we want to mutate an immutable type at runtime we must use RefCell which is a single threaded smart 
    pointer and for mutating type between multiple threads we must use Mutex or RwLock to avoid deadlocks situations.
    
    Single Thread    Multithread             Usage
    Rc               --> Arc                 make the type shareable between scopes and threads
    RefCell          --> RwLock || Mutex     make the type mutable safe at runtime in scopes and threads

    everytime we try to move type betweeen scopes and threads without losing ownership we're taking a reference to that thread so:
        share and mutate the actual type using its &mut pointer in a single thread scope
        share and mutate the actual type using its Arc<RwLock<Type>> pointer in a multithread scope

                             Mutex Vs RwLock
           --------------------------------------------------


    Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock):

    A Mutex allows only one thread to access some data at any given time.
    Every time a thread wants to access the data, it must first lock the Mutex.
    If you have a situation where you have more writes than reads, or if the 
    reads and writes are roughly equal, a Mutex is usually the better choice.
    tokio::sync::Mutex is an asynchronous Mutex that is designed to work 
    with async code within tokio.
    
    RWLock (Read-Write Lock):

    A RWLock allows any number of threads to read the data if there isn't a thread writing to it.
    If a thread wants to write to the data, it must wait for all the readers to finish before it 
    can obtain the lock. If you have a situation where you have many more reads than writes, a RWLock 
    can be more efficient because it allows multiple readers to access the data simultaneously.
    tokio::sync::RwLock is an asynchronous Read-Write Lock that works within the async ecosystem of tokio.
    
    When to choose tokio::sync::Mutex:

    You have frequent writes.
    The critical section (the part of the code that needs exclusive access to the data) is quick.
    You want simplicity. Using a Mutex is straightforward and avoids the complexity of dealing with 
    multiple lock types.
    
    When to choose tokio::sync::RwLock:

    You have many more reads than writes.
    You want to allow concurrent reads for efficiency.
    The critical section for reads is fast, but itâs still beneficial to have multiple readers at the same time.
    In many scenarios, a Mutex might be sufficient and can be the simpler choice, especially if write operations 
    are as common as reads or if the critical section is very short, thus not justifying the overhead of managing 
    a RWLock.

    However, if your specific case involves a lot of concurrent reads with infrequent writes and the read operations 
    are substantial enough to create a bottleneck, a RWLock might be a better choice.

           --------------------------------------------------


        single thread and none gc concepts: ltg &mut pointer (rc,refcell,arc,mutex,lazy,threadlocal),box,pin,impl Trait,

        code order execution and synchronization in multithreaded based envs like
        actor worker like having static lazy arced mutex data without having deadlocks 
        and race conditions using std::sync tokio::sync objects like 
        semaphore,arc,mutex,rwlock,mpsc also data collision, memory corruption, deadlocks 
        and race conditions avoidance in async and multithreaded contexts are: 
            - share none global app state data between tokio::spawn() threads using mpsc 
            - enum and actor id as unique storage key
            - mutate a global storage using thread local in single-threaded contexts
            - mutate a gloabl storage using static lazy arc mutexed in multi-threaded contexts
            - can't move out of a reference or deref a type if its pointer is being used by and shared with other scopes
            - can't mutate data without acquiring the lock of the mutex in other threads
            - can't have both mutable and immutable pointers at the same time

    reasons rust don't have static global types:
        
        Memory Safety: One of Rust's main goals is to ensure memory safety without the need 
               for a garbage collector. Global state can lead to shared mutable state across 
               threads, which is a source of data races. By making global state explicit and 
               synchronized, Rust avoids these issues.

        Concurrency: Rust's concurrency model revolves around the concept of ownership. Global 
               variables can be problematic in concurrent programs, where multiple threads might 
                want to modify a global variable simultaneously.

        Predictability and Explicitness: Global mutable state can make programs unpredictable 
                and hard to reason about. Rust values explicitness over implicitness, so when you 
                see a piece of Rust code, you can easily understand its behavior without having to 
                consider hidden global states.

        Lifetimes: Rust uses lifetimes to track how long data is valid. Global state has a complex 
                lifetime that can easily lead to dangling references if not managed carefully.
                with this in mind there is no need to define a global mutexed response object
                and reload it everytime in each api to avoid runtime memory overloading, cause rust
                will handle this automatically by using the concept of borrowing and lifetime

        No Garbage Collector: While the presence or absence of a garbage collector (GC) isn't the 
                main reason Rust is cautious with global state, it's worth noting. Many languages 
                with GCs allow for more liberal use of global state because the GC can clean up. 
                In Rust, manual memory management means you need to be more careful.

    heap data need to be behind pointer or their slice form, for traits they must be behind Box<dyn or 
    &dyn, for String and Vec need to be &str and &[], good to know that if we want to return pointer to 
    heap data from method they must be in their slice form with a valid lifetime like pointer to closure 
    traits as method param and return type, if the heap data is one of the field of a structure it's ok 
    to return a pointer with a valid lifetime to that cause the pointer will be valid as long as the &self 
    is valid and once we move self into a new scope like tokio::spawn() we can't do this although rust won't
    allow move self to new scope in the first place, in general we shouldn't return pointer to type from 
    method since rust handled each type lifetime automatically unless it's a mutable pointer cause mutating 
    a mutable pointer will mutate the actual type

    global state of type requires to have a complex valid lifetime like 'static and be mutable which this can't 
    be happend since rust doesn't have gc logic to track the lifetime of the type based on the references to that 
    type although it has Rc and Weak which can be used to count the references of a type but instead it uses the 
    concept of borrowing and ownership which is about destroying the type and drop its lifetime from the ram once 
    the type goes out of the scope like by moving heap data types into a function scope in essence by mutating an 
    static lifetime type we may face deadlock and race conditions issues in other threads, instead we can define 
    an static mutex since static types are immutable by default and because static values must be constant we must 
    put the mutex inside Lazy, like the following:
    since we can't return none const from a static type thus we have to 
    put it inside the lazy as a closure which returns the actual type 
    because Arc and RwLock are none const types although we can implement 
    this logic using thread_local!{},

    note that the data we want to share it between threads must be Send + Sync + 'static
    eg: Lazy<std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<ZoomateResponse>>> + Send + Sync + 'static 
    as a mutable global data will be shared between apis to mutate it safely to avoid deadlocks 
    and race conditions and the sharing process can be done using mpsc jobq channel sender
    so having the following is wrong since the static value must be const and Arc and RwLock
    are none const types hence we must put them inside Lazy<>: 
        pub static MULTI_THREAD_THINGS: std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<Vec<u8>>> = 
            std::sync::Arc::new(tokio::sync::RwLock::new(Vec::new()));
    is wrong and we should use the following syntaxes instead:

concepts:
    shared ownership, 
    interior mutability, 
    weak, and strong references

Shared ownership
    While the children are owned by the struct, it is necessary to provide access to these 
    children node to other code that use this tree data structure. Moving these references 
    out of the tree isnât desirable. And cloning the entire node before moving it out of the 
    tree isnât optimal either. This is where shared onwnership comes into play. In order to 
    do that, we wrap the underlying node in a Rc. This is a reference counted pointer. However, 
    that isnât enough, since once we pass a (shared) reference to other code (that is using 
        this tree), we need to provide the ability to mutate what is inside the node itself, 
        which leads us to interior mutability.
Interior mutability
    Once a reference (that allows for shared ownership) of a node is passed to code 
    using the tree, it becomes necessary to allow modifications to the underlying node 
    itself. This requires us to use interior mutability by wrapping the node in a 
    RefCell. Which is then wrapped in the Rc that we use to share ownership. Combining 
    these two together gets us to where we need to be.


NodeData

 |                 This describes a non-ownership relationship.
 |                 When a node is dropped, its parent will not be dropped.
 |
 +---- children: RwLock<Vec<Child<T>>> ---+
                                          |
                This describes an ownership relationship.
                When a node is dropped its children will be dropped as well.


1 - When a node is dropped, its children will be dropped as well (since it owns them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a strong reference.

2 - However, the parent should not be dropped (since it does not own them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a weak reference.

        types that implement Unpin can be moved safely but those types likes futures and tratis that
        implements !Unpin are not safe to be moved and if we need them later to use them like solving
        a future object we must pin their pointer into the ram to prevent them from moving so we need
        Pin them to safely poll them or solve them using .await, by pinning the pointer of the type
        we can tell the rust that hey don't move this type around the ram.
        trait objects like closures are dynamically sized means they're stored on the heap in order 
        to act them as a separate object or type we need to either put them behind a pointer or box 
        them, this would be true about the futures cause they're traits too.
        future objects must be pinned to the ram before they can be solved or polled the reason 
        of doing this is first of all they're trait objects and traits are dynamically sized means 
        they're size will be known at runtime second of alldue to the fact that rust doesnât have 
        gc which allows us not to have a tracking reference counting process for a type at runtime 
        cause itâll move the type if the type goes out of the scope hence in order to solve and

        once we await on the future but if we want to solve and poll a mutable reference of a future 
        we should stick and pin it to the ram manually, first by pinning the future into the ram using 
        Box::pin, tokio::pin!(), std::pin::pin!() then do an await on the mutable reference of the 
        future object, so if it is required to call .await on a &mut _ reference, the caller is 
        responsible for pinning the future by pinning future objects manually we make them as an object
