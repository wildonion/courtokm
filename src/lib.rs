    build dl models based on phases dataset using keras and https://github.com/wildonion/stem/
    behavioural graph virtual machine (**GVM**) built on top of each event's `phases` field inside 
    the game for each player to suggests them the tips and tricks for a new game and reward them 
    based on their game scores using an AI based coin generation model in essence, each player gets 
    rewarded and ranked based on their scores and in-game positions then the `balance` field will 
    be updated based on those attributes, the match making rating (**MMR**) engine, on the other 
    hand is is a weighted tree based suggestion engine that suggests players, events and other 
    games based on their past experiences, scores, tokens and rewards earned using **GVM** 
    during the game.
    


    this is lle parallel based vm and game engine graph like DOM, an state manager 
    like yew and redux with tree walking using (shared ref and mutably) using rc and 
    arc weak and strong ref counting, shared ownership and interior mutability, based on 
    actor and graph concepts so we have followers weighted tree to understand the 
    relationship between peers to suggests events in a graph virtual machine by using 


    ret &'validlifetime ref and trait as param like -> impl Trait as type from method and use them in method 
    param like param: impl Trait from method also can't move type if it's behind pointer send sync static, 
    shared ownership using Mutex and RwLock and RefCell, GlobalAlloc arena referene counting using Rc Arc, Box 
    leaking, Pin, &mut type, cap, length, macros, Cow, Borrowed, ToOwned, as_ref(), &mut (ast, token stream), 
    std::mem, generic, lifetimes, closures, traits, pointers and bytecode, .so and .elf bpf, wasm, bytes and 
    hex serding and codec ops using borsh and serde, async trait and associative bounding Trait::method(): Send and 
    ?async and ?const, r3bl_rs_utils crate, read/write io traits, Box<dyn Trait>, as_ref(), unwrap(), clone() 
    and trait as type also can't move type when it's behind a pointer and Box stores data on the heap and contains 
    an smart pointer with a valid lifetime to the underlying type, also the size of the boxed type is the size 
    of the type itself, the value of the box can be caught by dereferencing the box
    

    every type has its own lifetime and if it goes out of scope it'll be dropped from the ram and we can 
    either borrow it or clone it since rust dones't have gc instead it has rc, refcell for single thread 
    and arc and mutex for multithread reference counting and borrowing based on these concetps share ownership 
    between threads using Arc by borrowing the ownership using pointers like & clone share ownership between 
    scopes using Rc by  borrwoing the ownership using pointers like & and clone Rc is not safe to be used between 
    threads but Arc can be used to share the type between multiple threads safely without having race conditions, 
    also if we want to mutate an immutable type at runtime we must use RefCell which is a single threaded smart 
    pointer and for mutating type between multiple threads we must use Mutex or RwLock to avoid deadlocks situations.
    
    Single Thread    Multithread             Usage
    Rc               --> Arc                 make the type shareable between scopes and threads
    RefCell          --> RwLock || Mutex     make the type mutable safe at runtime in scopes and threads

    reasons rust don't have static global types:
        
        Memory Safety: One of Rust's main goals is to ensure memory safety without the need 
               for a garbage collector. Global state can lead to shared mutable state across 
               threads, which is a source of data races. By making global state explicit and 
               synchronized, Rust avoids these issues.

        Concurrency: Rust's concurrency model revolves around the concept of ownership. Global 
               variables can be problematic in concurrent programs, where multiple threads might 
                want to modify a global variable simultaneously.

        Predictability and Explicitness: Global mutable state can make programs unpredictable 
                and hard to reason about. Rust values explicitness over implicitness, so when you 
                see a piece of Rust code, you can easily understand its behavior without having to 
                consider hidden global states.

        Lifetimes: Rust uses lifetimes to track how long data is valid. Global state has a complex 
                lifetime that can easily lead to dangling references if not managed carefully.

        No Garbage Collector: While the presence or absence of a garbage collector (GC) isn't the 
                main reason Rust is cautious with global state, it's worth noting. Many languages 
                with GCs allow for more liberal use of global state because the GC can clean up. 
                In Rust, manual memory management means you need to be more careful.


    we've to initialize shared data once and share them between threads and scopes by cloning inside 
    the tokio mutex since rust doesn't have gc and because of that there is no concept of global storage 
    allocation because it's not thread and memory safe, we have to initialize an static data using lazy 
    std arc and tokio mutex.
    
    global state of type requires to have a complex valid lifetime like 'static 
    and be mutable which this can't be happend since rust doesn't gc and by mutating 
    an static lifetime type we may face deadlock and race conditions issues in other 
    threads, instead we can define an static mutex since static types are immutable 
    by default and because static values must be constant we must put the mutex 
    inside Lazy, like the following:

// note that the data we want to share it between threads must be Send + Sync + 'static
// eg: Lazy<std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<MapDataStruct>>> + Send + Sync + 'static 
// as a mutable global data will be shared between apis to mutate it safely 
// to avoid deadlocks and race conditions
// more info: see a thread safe global response object sample in https://github.com/wildonion/zoomate/blob/main/src/lib.rs

    // has its destructor running, and it may panic if the destructor has previously

concepts:
    shared ownership, 
    interior mutability, 
    weak, and strong references

Shared ownership
    While the children are owned by the struct, it is necessary to provide access to these 
    children node to other code that use this tree data structure. Moving these references 
    out of the tree isnât desirable. And cloning the entire node before moving it out of the 
    tree isnât optimal either. This is where shared onwnership comes into play. In order to 
    do that, we wrap the underlying node in a Rc. This is a reference counted pointer. However, 
    that isnât enough, since once we pass a (shared) reference to other code (that is using 
        this tree), we need to provide the ability to mutate what is inside the node itself, 
        which leads us to interior mutability.
Interior mutability
    Once a reference (that allows for shared ownership) of a node is passed to code 
    using the tree, it becomes necessary to allow modifications to the underlying node 
    itself. This requires us to use interior mutability by wrapping the node in a 
    RefCell. Which is then wrapped in the Rc that we use to share ownership. Combining 
    these two together gets us to where we need to be.


NodeData
 | | |
 | | +- value: T ---------------------------------------+
 | |                                                    |
 | |                                        Simple onwership of value
 | |
 | +-- parent: RwLock<WeakNodeNodeRef<T>> --------+
 |                                            |
 |                 This describes a non-ownership relationship.
 |                 When a node is dropped, its parent will not be dropped.
 |
 +---- children: RwLock<Vec<Child<T>>> ---+
                                          |
                This describes an ownership relationship.
                When a node is dropped its children will be dropped as well.


1 - When a node is dropped, its children will be dropped as well (since it owns them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a strong reference.

2 - However, the parent should not be dropped (since it does not own them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a weak reference.
